        <p> <em>Focal Point Environmental Sustainability</em></p>
        <p>With almost 20 years of professional experience within the Red Cross and its international
          work I have strong skills in leading teams, representation as well as managing relationships and projects - that I have been able to expand in subsequent positions of greater responsibility and authority. My expertise is both academic, with
          a
          Master degree in development management, and gained from practical experience in the development and humanitarian sector, including the fields of water/sanitation, food security, disaster risk reduction and advocacy. Within my team and
          across
          cultures I have always promoted mutual respect, enthusiasm for our work and a spirit of co-operation.
